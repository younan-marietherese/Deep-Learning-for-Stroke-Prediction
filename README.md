Stroke Risk Prediction – Deep Learning Case Study
Ranked Top 1 in this project as part of the Zaka.ai Artificial Intelligence Certification – Machine Learning Specialization

Objective
This project aims to help a public health organization identify individuals most at risk of having a stroke using a dataset of patient health indicators. The goal is to build and optimize a neural network model for stroke prediction while going through the full data science lifecycle.

Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn

SMOTE (imbalanced-learn) for data balancing

Threshold tuning, Grid Search, and architecture optimization

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Highlights
Completed full ML pipeline: EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

Built and improved multiple deep learning models

Applied SMOTE and threshold tuning to boost recall for better healthcare decision-making


Results
Achieved significant improvements in recall and overall performance by iteratively refining the model architecture and applying smart resampling and thresholding techniques.
